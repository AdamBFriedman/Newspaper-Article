						Sometimes your life just changes. One day you're on the business path of Accounting and Project
						Management, and then BOOM - a career change happens! Well, this happened to a young front-end
						developer who fell into the world of tech by chance... and never looked back.
					</p>
					<p>
						The developer, whose work includes a <em>COVID-19 Tracker</em>, clarified, "Well, I didn't
						<em>mean</em> to get into web development, it just sort of happened". The company I was working
						for, he said, needed their website redone and I was curious about what that process would look
						like. After taking a month to learn the ins and outs of HTML/CSS, the developer moved onto
						learning JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						"I don't know, it just sort of came to me. I understood it." he told Google during his one of
						his onsite interviews. Google, whose corporate mission is to organize the world's information
						and make it universally accessible and useful, declined to comment.

						<p>
							Think you’re too busy to get away from work? You might be surprised to find that going on
							vacation – whether a weekend getaway or a weeks-long break – is exactly what the doctor
							ordered. Scientific research has discovered what many of us intuitively know – what we
							really need is some time away from the workplace, wherever in the world we call home. What
							is it about going “on holiday” that boosts our well-being, relieves stress and helps us live
							fuller lives? Check out Hotel Friedman for a luxurious experience at competitive rates.

					<h4>Brady Bunch or Friedman Bunch?</h4>
					<p>
						The <del>Brady</del> Friedman Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz that
						aired from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on ABC. The series revolves around a large
						blended family with six children. Considered one of the last of the old-style family sitcoms,
						the series aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into syndication in
						September 1975.

					<h4>Are you having trouble sorting arrays?</h4>
					<p>
						Explore one of the fastest sorting algorithms in existence. <em>Merge Sort</em> is a
						<em>Divide and Conquer</em> algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself
						for the two halves and then merges the sorted halves. The Big O complexity for this sorting
						method is O(n*log(n)) which barrels through its competition (quick, heap, insertion, and
						bubble).

							the line a little longer. We all remember how it works.
