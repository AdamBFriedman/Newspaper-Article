						Sometimes your life just changes. One day you're on the business path of Accounting and Project
						Management, and then BOOM - a career change happens! Well, this happened to a young front-end
						developer who fell into the world of tech by chance... and never looked back.
					</p>
					<p>
						The developer, whose work includes a <em>COVID-19 Tracker</em>, clarified, "Well, I
						didn't <em>mean</em> to get into web development, it just sort of happened". The company I was working
						for, he said, needed their website redone and I was curious about what that process would look
						like. After taking a month to learn the ins and outs of HTML/CSS, the developer moved onto
						learning JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						"I don't know, it just sort of came to me. I understood it." he told Google during his one of
						his onsite interviews. Google, whose corporate mission is to organize the world's information
						and make it universally accessible and useful, declined to comment.
